Predicting the academic outcome of a student can be beneficial for a plethora of reasons. With this project we aim to understand and  predict students’ dropout and success rate using machine learning 
techniques. After preprocessing and analyzing the available data, we used different 
algorithms to train and predict the students’ status based on key features. We implemented five machine learning algorithms: 
Decision Tree, Bayesian Classifier and a MLP Neural Network as classifying algorithms and K-means and DBSCAN as clustering algorithms.
